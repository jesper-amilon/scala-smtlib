 * An interpreter is a stateful object that can eval Commands and returns
 * CommandResponse.
 *
 * Note that despite returning the command response, the interpreter should handle the printing
 * of those responses itself. That is because it needs to handle the verbosity and *-output-channel
 * options commands, and will do the correct printing depending on the internal state.
 * The responses are returned as a way to progamatically communicate with a solver.

 * TODO: The interaction of the set-option for the channels with the eval interface
         seems just wrong. Need to clarify that.
